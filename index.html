	<p>
		Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
		In fair Verona where we lay our scene,<br>
		From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
		Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>


		From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,<br>
		A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,<br>
		Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
		Doth, with their death, bury their parents' strife.<br>


		The fearful passage of their death-marked love<br>
		And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>                 
		Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
		Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>


		The which, if you with patient ears attend,<br>
		What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
